## Build and Install

### Windows

##### Prerequisites:

- Windows 7 or later
- Visual Studio 2017
- Git
- CMake

##### Step:
Using Visual Studio 2017
1. Pull all source
2. Run command line 
```batch
cd path/to/ARK
cd Dep
build_dep.bat
```
3. Open the solution: `Frame/ARK.sln`
4. Build the solution`ARK.sln`
5. Run `ARK\Bin\resource\tool\gen-config.bat` to generate configuration files
6. Run the binary file by `Bin/rund.bat`

Using CMake
1. Pull all source
2. Run command line
```batch
cd path/to/ARK
cd Dep
build_dep.bat
cd ../
md build
cd build
cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 Win64" ..
```
4. Start `ARK.sln`
5. Run `ARK\Bin\resource\tool\gen-config.bat` to generate configuration files
6. Run the binary file by `Bin/rund.bat`

> Note
> - If you are using VS2017, please change `%VS150COMNTOOLS%` in `Dep/build_dep.bat` to `YOUR-COMPILER-PATH`.
> - If you DO NOT install **Win10 SDK**, please use **CMake** to create new solution.

### linux

##### Prerequisites:

- g++ 4.8+ (need C++ 11)
- Git
- CMake 3.0+
- libtool
- automake

Using CMake
1. pull all source
2. Use bash
```shell
cd Dep
./build_dep.sh
cd ../
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ..
make
```
> Note
> - If you need build debug, please add `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="Debug"` in cmake command.
> - To accelerate building, you can use `make -j` to run multiple complication jobs simultaneously. However, that may exhaust the memory.
3. Run `ARK\Bin\resource\tool\gen-config.sh` to generate configuration files(*Cuz our Tools is written by C#, so please generate your configuration in Windows, we plan to use .Net Core to create a new version in Linux*)
4. Run the binary file by `Bin/rund.sh`

#### The relationship with NF

This branch come from [NF](https://github.com/ketoo/NoahGameFrame), we used to be the **CORE DEVELOPERS** of NF. We create **ARK** because some different design philosophies, through our new ideas and modifications, now this project is a fresh project which has many different features.
